## My FreeCodeCamp Machine Learning Projects 🤖

This repository showcases my solutions to the Machine Learning challenges on FreeCodeCamp.org. 

This course and certificate available at: [freeCodeCamp - Machine Learning with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/)

Here's a quick overview of each project:

**1. Rock, Paper, Scissors 👊✋✌️**

* **boilerplate-rock-paper-scissors:**  A program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors against four different bots. The goal is to achieve a win rate of at least 60% against each bot. 

**2. Cat or Dog? 🐈🐕**

* **fcc_cat_dog:** This project uses TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras to build a convolutional neural network that classifies images of cats and dogs with at least 63% accuracy.  

**3. Predicting Healthcare Costs 🏥**

* **fcc_predict_health_costs_with_regression:**  A regression model that predicts healthcare costs based on a dataset containing information about individuals. 

**4. Book Recommendations with KNN 📚**

* **fcc_book_recommendation_knn:** This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to recommend books based on user preferences. 

**5. SMS Spam Detection 📨**

* **fcc_sms_text_classification:**  A machine learning model that classifies SMS messages as either "ham" (normal messages) or "spam" (advertisements or company messages). 

**Feel free to explore the code and learn from the solutions. Happy coding! 💻**
